# Introduction 

This website is an open source initiative to document the evolution of prediction markets and serve as a reliable source of academic journals, newsletters, videos and news.

## What are prediction markets?

Prediction markets are markets where participants can buy and sell contracts whose payoffs are tied to the outcomes of future events.

## How do prediction markets work?

They are markets that uses prices as probabilities to make predictions. Here's a simple example: A prediction market could be set up around the question "Will it rain in New York City on July 4th?". Traders would buy shares that pay $1 if it rains, and $0 if it doesn't, or vice versa. If many people think it will rain, the rain shares will be in high demand, driving up their price towards $1. If most think it won't rain, the no-rain shares will trade higher.

## What are the types of prediction markets?

There are several models of prediction markets that have been tried, including free money prediction markets, reputation based prediction markets, blockchain prediction markets & zero commission markets.  Prediction markets are sometimes also known as information markets, event futures, event derivatives, betting markets, idea futures or decision markets.  

## What is the wisdom of the crowds?

he wisdom of the crowds refers to the phenomenon that the collective opinion or judgment of a group can often be more accurate than any single individual's opinion. This concept was popularized by James Surowiecki's book "The Wisdom of Crowds" which was published in 2004. Prediction markets leverage the collective wisdom of the crowd to arrive at crowd-sourced probability estimates. These markets often prove to be more accurate than individual “expert” opinions, polls, or institutions. 

## Are prediction markets legal?

The information presented may be out of date. Do your own research before trading, and obviously, this does not constitute financial or investment advice.

Prediction market legality depends where you are based. In the United States, prediction market regulations are inconsistent and strict on elections, economics and sports. Regulation varies wildly state by state and federally, where different markets are regulated by different governing bodies.

If you live outside of the United States, your options improve greatly with exchanges for elections, crypto and sports markets. Exchanges like Polymarket, Betfair, Smarkets, and SX.bet offer a wide range of markets where hundreds of millions of dollars are traded weekly. 

Binary markets on commodities, bitcoin, forex and equities indices are allowed federally on exchanges like CME, Kalshi, and Nadex.

Election markets are banned in the US, with an exception given to PredictIt by the CFTC in 2014 that allowed them to take wagers of up to $850 per election market. Eight years later, in August 2022, CFTC rescinded this arrangement. In March 2023, PredictIt successfully challenged this in Fifth Circuit court of appeals. The CFTC also banned Kalshi from election markets in September 2022 and in November 2023 Kalshi sued the CFTC.

Sports markets exist in the US but they are only allowed in New Jersey or Colorado on exchanges like Sporttrade, Prophet, SBK and Novig.
